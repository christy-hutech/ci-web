Long-term research in Dibang Valley (including areas which will see impacts of the proposed hydro-project) show that the region is a very important habitat for many Schedule I endangered species, including a genetically distinct population of tigers, 75 species of other mammals and over 300 species of birds.\r\n              </p> \r\n\r\n              <p>\r\n                The proposed hydro-electric project is, in my opinion, detrimental to India’s biodiversity and ecological security, and therefore I respectfully request that the FAC reject it.\r\n              </p>  \r\n\r\n              <p>Yours truly,</p>\r\n              <p>The undersigned</p>\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"viewpoints sub-content\">\r\n            <p>\r\n              While there are multiple local viewpoints about the dams in Dibang valley, this campaign simply seeks to highlight the loss of exceptional biodiversity that could result from the construction of the dam.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"sub-section-3\">\r\n          <div className=\"editorial\">\r\n          {\r\n            // campaignData?.map((elem,index)=>{\r\n            //   return (\r\n            //     <>\r\n            //     <h1>{index === 0 ? elem?.maimTitle : ''}</h1>\r\n            //     <div className=\"editorial-content\">\r\n            //       <h3>{elem?.title || ''}</h3>\r\n            //       <p>{elem?.content || ''}</p>\r\n            //     </div>\r\n            //     </>\r\n            //   )\r\n            // })\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n      </section>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default CampaignDetails"],"mappings":";;;AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,OAAO,uBAAP;;;;;;AAMA,SAASC,YAAT,QAA6B,eAA7B;;AAGA,IAAMC,eAAe,GAAG,SAAlBA,eAAkB,GAAK;EAC3BC,OAAO,CAACC,GAAR,CAAYH,YAAZ;EACA,IAAMA,YAAY,GAAG,EAArB;EACA,oBACE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,0BAAf;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAS,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAnB;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAM,SAAS,EAAC,wBAAhB;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,cAAf;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,kEADF,eAIE;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,uOAJF,eAQE;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,wCARF,CADF,eAWE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,aAAf;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAf;IAAwB,GAAG,EAAEI,WAA7B;IAA0C,GAAG,EAAC,QAA9C;IAAuD,KAAK,EAAC,KAA7D;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EADF,CAXF,CADF,CADF,eAmBE;IAAU,SAAS,EAAC,oBAApB;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,wBAAf;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAG;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAf;IAAwB,GAAG,EAAEC,MAA7B;IAAqC,GAAG,EAAC,QAAzC;IAAkD,KAAK,EAAC,IAAxD;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EAAH,CADF,eAEE;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAG;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAf;IAAwB,GAAG,EAAEC,MAA7B;IAAqC,GAAG,EAAC,QAAzC;IAAkD,KAAK,EAAC,IAAxD;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EAAH,CAFF,eAGE;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAG;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAf;IAAwB,GAAG,EAAEC,WAA7B;IAA0C,GAAG,EAAC,QAA9C;IAAuD,KAAK,EAAC,IAA7D;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EAAH,CAHF,CADF,eAME;IAAK,SAAS,EAAE,uBAAhB;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,aAAf;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,ojBADF,eAIE;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gmBAJF,CADF,eASE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,KAAf;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,OAAf;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAf;IAAwB,GAAG,EAAEC,OAA7B;IAAsC,GAAG,EAAC,QAA1C;IAAmD,KAAK,EAAC,IAAzD;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EADF,CADF,eAIE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,aAAf;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,mIADF,eAIE;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gEAJF,CAJF,CATF,eAoBE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,aAAf;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gWADJ,eAKI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gFALJ,eAOI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,oOAPJ,eAWI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gcAXJ,6IAiBI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,sLAjBJ,CApBF,eAyCE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAf;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,qDADF,eAII;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gFAJJ,eAMI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,0iBANJ,eAUI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,2LAVJ,eAcI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,kBAdJ,eAeI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,qBAfJ,CAzCF,eA2DE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,wBAAf;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,iNADF,CA3DF,CANF,eAuEE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,eAAf;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EADF,CAvEF,CAnBF,CADF;AAiHD,CApHD;;AAsHA,eAAeP,eAAf"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
