Connectivity is forged by animal movements – or\r\n              dispersal – across large heterogeneous landscapes. Connectivity\r\n              boosts the ability of animals to persist over time, and enhances\r\n              both immunity and adaptability of animal populations, and helps\r\n              prevent local extinctions. When local extinctions do occur,\r\n              connectivity allows animals to recolonise previously occupied but\r\n              currently empty or depauperate habitats.\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className={styles.heading1}>Problems with Habitant</div>\r\n            <div className={styles.para2}>\r\n              Today, habitats are sometimes severely fragmented, and human\r\n              presence has drastically restricted animal movement. This limits\r\n              their ability to traverse fragmented landscapes. Even\r\n              well-intentioned measures sometimes block connectivity. For\r\n              example, the large-scale erection of fences around protected areas\r\n              as a purported solution for reducing human–wildlife conflict\r\n              blocks connectivity, and can isolate populations. There is thus,\r\n              much to be learnt and done to ensure that linkages across animal\r\n              populations continue to be maintained.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              All of the above holds especially true for the Asian elephant\r\n              (Elephas maximus), India’s National Heritage Animal and an\r\n              endangered species that is present across 13 countries in Asia.\r\n              Elephants range widely, sometimes over 100s of kilometres, to meet\r\n              their immense food and water requirements. To put this in context,\r\n              the average size of protected areas in India is 300 km2, close to\r\n              the average home range size of a single elephant herd. In\r\n              recognition of this need to expand conservation efforts outside\r\n              protected areas, government policy has rightly identified the\r\n              ‘landscape’ as a unit of conservation for elephants. Thus,\r\n              Elephant Reserves, by design, are meant to incorporate protected\r\n              source habitats, corridors, and multiple-use areas. But practice\r\n              is slow to follow policy; elephant corridors are not well\r\n              identified, factors that facilitate or impede elephant movement\r\n              within and across Elephant Reserves are yet to be well studied,\r\n              and conservation practice and actions on-ground are not geared\r\n              towards landscape-scale conservation of elephants.\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className={styles.head2}>Asian Elephants</div>\r\n            <div className={styles.para3}>\r\n              Our research, published in Diversity and Distributions, addresses\r\n              these issues squarely. We have used data on elephant presence\r\n              across heterogeneous areas to identify locations most suited to\r\n              elephant dispersal, as well as factors that facilitate or impede\r\n              such movement.\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className={styles.head3}>Diversity and Distributions</div>\r\n            <div className={styles.para4}>\r\n              We collected empirical data on elephant use of lands outside\r\n              protected areas—paddy fields, plantations, human habitations, and\r\n              forestland—across 7,500 km2. We used these data in newly developed\r\n              movement models to identify areas most critical to connectivity\r\n              across a 20,000 km2 region of Northeast India. This work is\r\n              significant for a few reasons. One, dispersal and connectivity,\r\n              occurring infrequently and across large landscapes, has\r\n              traditionally been a difficult subject of study. Collecting data\r\n              relevant to animal use of landscapes has been difficult,\r\n              especially because events of animal movement in certain important\r\n              corridor areas may happen just a few times a year. We took\r\n              advantage of the fact that elephants are visible, noticed by\r\n              people, and are unambiguously recognisable, to systematically\r\n              collect citizen-reports of elephant use of a multitude of areas.\r\n              We questioned 1000 farmers across this region, recording each time\r\n              a respondent reported elephant presence in their immediate\r\n              neighbourhood. In total we used 200 reports of elephant presence\r\n              in multiple-use lands to model connectivity.{\" \"}\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className={styles.head4}>Empirical Data</div>\r\n            <div className={styles.para5}>\r\n              imultaneously, we recorded factors that may impede or facilitate\r\n              elephant movement. We used the Google Earth Engine and satellite\r\n              imagery to classify the entire region into different land cover\r\n              types. We used existing information on human population density,\r\n              and calculated distance to forest and vegetation cover. We found\r\n              that elephants used areas with high vegetation cover for movement.\r\n              Despite being animals that can traverse great distances, they did\r\n              not venture far from forests, highlighting the role of forests as\r\n              refuges for these and other species. They avoided areas with a\r\n              high human population density, likely associating risk with human\r\n              presence and potential conflict.\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div>\r\n              <img src={Img2} className={styles.img2} />\r\n              <div className={styles.img2_details}>\r\n                Elephants use areas of high vegetation cover and low human\r\n                presence, that are close to forests for dispersal.

A recognised\r\n              issue of such models is the need for them to be informed by\r\n              empirical data relevant to animal movement and use of the\r\n              landscape. While our data does not track elephant movement per\r\n              se—like radio telemetry does—it does offer pertinent insight on\r\n              elephant use of lands outside protected areas. Such a combination\r\n              opens opportunities for applying advanced connectivity models for\r\n              species or landscapes otherwise limited by lack of appropriate\r\n              data.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              The results of our model are two-fold. One, it answers the\r\n              question, where should elephant connectivity conservation (e.g.,\r\n              securing corridors, protecting existing forests, removing\r\n              blockades and fences, incentivising safe elephant passage through\r\n              private lands) be focused, via fine-scale 1-km2 maps. Second, it\r\n              addresses the issue of why elephants move through some areas and\r\n              not others, and thus provides an indication to how we can\r\n              strategically target connectivity conservation action. For\r\n              instance, our work adds to previous findings from scientific\r\n              studies, including our own work, that vegetation and wooded areas\r\n              even on private lands, can facilitate critical animal movement.\r\n              Government policies that encourage woody vegetation on private\r\n              lands, incentivise preservation of wooded areas on private lands,\r\n              and strictly limit deforestation in important connectivity areas,\r\n              are clearly indicated.\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div>\r\n              <img src={Img3} className={styles.img2} />\r\n              <div className={styles.img2_details}>\r\n                Elephants use areas of high vegetation cover and low human\r\n                presence, that are close to forests for dispersal.

Corridors for elephants may serve as important\r\n              movement zones for other less studied species as well.\r\n              Connectivity conservation occurs at the human–wildlife interface\r\n              and guides us to look for conservation approaches that facilitate\r\n              shared human–wildlife spaces and their coexistence. Connectivity\r\n              is also recognised as a key mitigation tool for climate change.\r\n              For all these reasons and more, connectivity conservation assumes\r\n              prime importance, and science that guides and backs connectivity\r\n              conservation policy and on-ground action is urgently needed. With\r\n              our work, we seek to fill this knowledge gap, and thus improve our\r\n              practice of connectivity conservation.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              The paper referred to in this article, titled ‘Identifying\r\n              important connectivity areas for the wide‐ranging Asian elephant\r\n              across conservation landscapes of Northeast India’, is published\r\n              in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Diversity and\r\n              Distributions, and can be accessed here:\r\n              <span style={{ color: \"red\" }}>\r\n                http://doi.org/10.1111/ddi.13419.\r\n              </span>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className={styles.border_bottom_gray}></div>\r\n            <div className={styles.tags}>\r\n              {tags.map((item, index) => {\r\n                return <Button>{item}</Button>;\r\n              })}\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className={styles.about_authors}>\r\n              <div className={styles.author_title}>About the authors</div>\r\n              <div className={styles.author_border_bottom}></div>\r\n              <div className={styles.author_name}>\r\n                Divya Vasudev & Varun R.
